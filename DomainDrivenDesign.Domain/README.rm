# This project for basic sample about how to use Domain, CommandHandle, EventHandle
- Each Domain (business) should place in separate project, to clear code, 
and dont care much about alot of Commands and Events
- Actually can add reference other Domain (business) to use or subcribe Event in need
- Eg: CheckinCreated -> AutoNumber must create. check class CheckinAndAutoNumberWorkfollow
## Workfollow. It just subscribe Events (of Domain business), then decide what Command should be next ( call command of other Domain business)
